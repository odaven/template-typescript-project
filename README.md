This is the bare minimum needed for testing Typescript with Jest.

- <code>jest.config.js</code> This is important because Jest does not understand typescript so we have to transform it first before the test. Without this you may have the error: `Error: SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module`
- <code>package.json</code> Here there is:
    - `@types/jest`: This package contains type definitions
    - `jest`: Jest itself
    - `ts-jest`: A Jest transformer with source map support that lets you use Jest to test projects written in TypeScript.
